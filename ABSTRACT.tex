Daylight changes over time. Not only the brightness but the colour. As we intuitively recognise, daylight is bluer in the morning and shifts towards yellow near the sunset. The purpose of this research is to collect accurate data against our estimation based on crude naked-eye observation. Using the consumer-grade spectrophotometer facing against the white surface, the data were collected every minute. The resulting data somewhat correlates to our common sense, but it was not static at all. These data can be used to accurately simulate an ambient light of real-world within the virtual environment, such as CGI and video games.
