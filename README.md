# Change of Daylight Colour throughtout a Day
## Measured with Spectrophotometer

Article and raw-data for Change of Daylight Colour over Time, Measured with Spectrophotometer


This repo is currently TBA, actual measurement will be conducted sooner or later.

I have done similar experiments with my Colourimeter, Spyder5, but colourimeters cannot give accurate results for light sources like sunlight, so I'll get a Spectrophotometer (likely ColorMunki Design) and conduct a real thing.
