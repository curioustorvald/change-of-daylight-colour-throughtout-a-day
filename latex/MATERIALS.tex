In preparing the spectrophotometer reading, photography-grade grey card (Horusbennu MQ-DGC-Z) were installed against a vertical frame, in this experiment it was a window frame on my apartment, facing south, then the spectrophotometer was affixed using mini tripod and box tape, facing the grey card. A laptop was prepared right next to the window, and two devices are connected via USB cable. Cron job was set so that data would be collected every minute, from 0500 to 1959. Spotread from ArgyllCMS was used as a software for data collection, with following command-line options: -N -T -x -e -O. Spectrophotometer used in this experiment was Xerox PhaserMeter, which is a re-brand of ColorMunki from X-Rite.
