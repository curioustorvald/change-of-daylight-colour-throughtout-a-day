Incident light was partially blocked with perforated aluminium foil. A laptop was prepared right next to the window, and two devices were connected via USB cable. Cron job was set so that data would be collected every minute. Spotread from ArgyllCMS was used as a software for data collection, with following command-line options: -T -x -a -O. X-Rite's i1Display Pro was used as a colourimeter.
