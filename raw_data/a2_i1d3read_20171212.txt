and hit [A-Z] to read white and setup FWA compensation (keyed to letter)
[a-z] to read and make FWA compensated reading from keyed reference
'r' to set reference, 's' to save spectrum,
'f' to report cal. refresh rate, 'F' to measure refresh rate
'h' to toggle high res., 'k' to do a calibration
Hit ESC or Q to exit, any other key to take a reading: 
 Result is XYZ: 0.062854 0.064284 0.068480, Yxy: 0.064284 0.321311 0.328618
 Ambient = 0.1 Lux, CCT = 6051K (Delta E 1.501503)
 Suggested EV @ ISO100 for 0.1 Lux incident light = -5.3
 Closest Planckian temperature = 6111K (Delta E 1.309341)
